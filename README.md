This guide is my attempt at documenting what I had to do to get my mining rig
going. I tried to make it as complete as I could if I missed any steps or you
have any suggestions let me know and I'll update. 

You should go in this order.

1. bootable flashdrive
2. install ubuntu
3. initial setup (optional)
4. amd_driver_installation
5. Installing ethereum software
